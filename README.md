Title: Student Success AI: Early Risk Detection & Personalized Counseling System

Short Description: An end-to-end Machine Learning system designed to identify students at risk of academic failure before final exams. It moves beyond simple prediction by providing Explainable AI (XAI) insights and a Context-Aware Counseling Engine that generates personalized, actionable feedback for students and counselors.

Key Features:

🧠 Predictive Modeling: Logistic Regression model optimized for Recall (79%) to prioritize student safety over raw accuracy.

🔍 Explainable AI: Uses SHAP values to explain why a student is flagged (e.g., "High Social Media Usage" vs. "Low Attendance").

📊 Context-Aware Benchmarking: Compares student metrics against Class Medians rather than arbitrary thresholds for fairer assessment.

🚀 "What-If" Simulator: An interactive Streamlit dashboard allowing students to simulate how habit changes (e.g., +1 hr study) improve their success probability.

Tech Stack: Python, Scikit-Learn, SHAP, Plotly, Streamlit.
